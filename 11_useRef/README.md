# 📅 Day 11 — useRef Hook

## 📌 What I Learned Today

Today I learned the **useRef Hook** in React.
`useRef` is used to store mutable values and access DOM elements without causing component re-render.

## 🎯 Concepts Covered

* Creating reference using `useRef()`
* Accessing DOM elements using `ref` attribute
* Using `ref.current`
* Focusing input field programmatically
* Storing previous state value
* Understanding difference between `useRef` and `useState`
