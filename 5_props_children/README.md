Today I learned important React concepts **Props Children**.

## 📚 What I Learned

### 1. Children

* `props.children` is used to pass **content inside component tags**
* Useful for wrapper / layout components

## 🧠 Key Understanding

* Props pass **data**
* Children pass **UI / JSX content**
* Both help build reusable and flexible components
